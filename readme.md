# LuminaLM Adaptive GPT

> **Advanced Self-Adaptive Language Models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**

## Overview

LuminaLM Adaptive GPT is a cutting-edge framework for self-adaptive language models that dynamically adjust to various tasks during inference without retraining. It leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for robust training and the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for real-time adaptation, achieving superior performance in tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, and summarization.

### Key Features
- **Self-Adaptive**: Adapts to new tasks at inference time.
- **Multi-Task Support**: Handles diverse NLP tasks with intelligent reward functions.
- **GPU-Optimized**: Efficient CUDA implementation with mixed precision.
- **Modular Design**: Extensible architecture for custom models and optimizers.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Integrates with Weights & Biases and TensorBoard.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd LuminaLM-Adaptive-GPT
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Quick Start

### Basic Training
Run the training script with the default configuration:
```bash
lumina-train --config configs/config.yaml
```

Or use the provided `start_training` script (after running `setup_luminalm.bat` or `setup_luminalm.sh`):
```bash
# On Windows
start_training.bat
# On Linux/macOS
./start_training.sh
```

### Python Example
```python
from lumina_adaptive_gpt.core import ModelConfig
from lumina_adaptive_gpt.training import LuminaGRPOTrainer
from lumina_adaptive_gpt.utils import setup_device

device = setup_device()
config = ModelConfig(
    model_name="gpt2",
    batch_size=8,
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    num_epochs=3,
    max_length=256,
    mixed_precision=False,
    output_dir="./results"
)
trainer = LuminaGRPOTrainer(config)
trainer.train_adaptive_model()
```

## Repository Structure
- `src/lumina_adaptive_gpt/`: Core source code (models, optimization, training).
- `configs/`: YAML configuration files for models, datasets, and optimization.
- `scripts/`: Training, evaluation, and experiment scripts.
- `examples/`: Example scripts and notebooks.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the codebase.
- `docs/`: Documentation and tutorials.

## Configuration
The framework uses a YAML-based configuration system. Example `configs/config.yaml`:
```yaml
experiment:
  name: "lumina_adaptive_experiment"
  output_dir: "./results"
training:
  num_epochs: 3
  batch_size: 8
  learning_rate: 1e-4
logging:
  wandb:
    enabled: true
    project: "lumina-adaptive-gpt"
```

## Final Point
After training, a `training_summary.json` file is saved in the output directory, containing experiment details, metrics, and configuration. Check this file to review training outcomes.

## Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
